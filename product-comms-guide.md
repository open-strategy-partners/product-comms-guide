# Product Communications Framework and Guide

Create compelling communications based on your technical truth. Brought to you by [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/).

## Introduction: How do we write better content for technology products? 

Technology products require a modular and agile approach to writing. Have you ever had a set of LEGO bricks that you played around with to create a plane, house, or skyscraper? We think about Product Communication similarly. We choose from a set of communication components to develop and shape the different Product Communications content you need: blogs, sales enablement assets, landing pages, and more.

Product Communications make clear your product’s value to technical and business audiences. In our approach, you should create communications assets from factual components based on a solid technical and strategic foundation, your “technical truth.”

- **Communications Assets** include webpages like product-, service- or persona pages, Value Maps, Product Data Sheets, and more.
- **Product Communication Components** include micro-copy, like taglines and CTAs, as well as longer text elements, like [positioning statements](#positioning-statements) and [Value Cases](#value-cases). (More on these later in this document.)

## Before we start, some technical communication values to write by

### Empathy
- **Put yourself in your audience’s shoes** to understand their challenges, needs, and context.
- **Use language that will resonate** with your audience, e.g., business terms for business readers and technical terms for developers.
- **Pitch your writing to your audience, but help others learn.** No one will hold against you explaining jargon and technical terminology, and you will help people new to your topic get up to speed.

### Clarity
- **Translate complicated and abstract technology concepts** into clear, compelling product communication.
- **Clearly structured writing and assets are more easily consumed** and, therefore, more effective. See our Writing and Editing Guide for more on formatting: headers, lists, avoiding walls of text, etc.  

### Trust
- **Empathy, clarity, and accuracy help build trust.**
- **Show that you understand your reader’s challenges.** They will identify themselves in your writing, trust you more, and keep reading.
- **Be transparent and honest about what you can’t offer** to build trust. Don’t sell vaporware ;-).
- **Avoid hyperbole.** It totally, massively, always helps, too.
- **Use (and explain) technical terminology accurately** to build trust.


## Our Product Communication Principles

The Product Communications Framework follows our [Writing and Editing Guide](https://github.com/open-strategy-partners/writing-guide).

### The best (most effective) product communications are:
1. **Tight:** *Every word takes up precious real estate. Make them count.*
2. **Specific:** *Use the most precise version of a word or phrase. Don’t generalize or be vague.*
3. **Accurate:** *Make factual statements supported by evidence.*
4. **Clean and Consistent:** *Grammar, spelling, style, and tone should be professional and consistent with your voice and tone.*
5. **Compelling:** *Tell stories. Use words, verbs, rhythm, and language that resonate.*
6. **Functional:** *A text has a job to do. Make sure it’s doing it.*

All the Value Map components are also components we use in Product Communications. The Value Map process produces the communication components you need to create content assets for your B2B product or service. Use the Value Map as your single source of truth to build communication assets, following our communication values and principles.

To learn more about the intersection of Product Communications and the OSP Value Map, see [Product Communications and the Value Map](#product-comms) in this guide.

## Tips for effective content writing for your tech

“Good” Product Communications applies these principles at every scope, from the smallest (e.g., a tagline or caption) to the largest (e.g., whole pages, websites, or campaigns).

### **\#1: Tight**

*“The goal isn’t brevity for its own sake but clarity” \- Frank Conroy.* 

*Every word takes up precious real estate. Make them count.* 

Interesting verbs: Replace “has,” “does,” “gives,” “stays,” or “keeps” \+ a noun with a more precise, more active verb. 

* Before: TYPO3 gives marketers the tools they need to simplify the many decisions they have to make on a daily basis.  
* After: TYPO3’s tools simplify your daily decisions

What to cut: “With” or “of” or “that,” go see if you can tighten that up

* Before: A CMS with a developer focus  
* After: A developer-focused CMS

Don’t use ten words if you can use five.

* Before: TYPO3 puts the support, flexibility, and features you need at your fingertips so you can start high-value projects quickly.    
* After: Launch projects quickly with TYPO3’s flexible Core and 24/7 support. 

### **\#2: Specific**

*Use the most precise version of a word or phrase. Don’t generalize or be vague.*

Highlight the unique and special aspects of (or relevant to) a product, service, company, or persona.

* Before: TYPO3 CMS was designed to support enterprises with the effective tools, systems, and frameworks that they need.   
* After: TYPO3 CMS supports enterprises with a User Access Management system, 24/7 support teams, and centralized Digital Asset Management. 

Less fill: Eradicate filler adjectives popular in tech-speak, like “efficient,” “innovative,” and “streamlined.” 

* Before: Get streamlined workflows that are customizable for editors’ and publishers’ needs.   
* After: Customize workflows to match your internal editing and approval process.

### **\#3: Accurate and true**

*Make factual statements supported by evidence.*

*Don’t make claims you can’t back up.*

Features are better than meaningless claims: Don’t use phrases like “the best” or competitive comparisons that cannot be substantiated. 

* Before: TYPO3’s editing tools are better than other CMSs.   
* After: TYPO3’s structured content and flexible workflows help editors tick off their task list. 

Back up your claims with evidence. 

* Before: TYPO3 has best-in-class security features.   
* After: TYPO3 was ranked first among open source CMSs in addressing vulnerabilities by SecurityRankerTM. 

### **\#4: Clean and Consistent** 

*Grammar, spelling, style, and tone should be professional and consistent with the client’s voice and tone.* 

Get help: Use the available tools to double-check grammar and spelling issues. Helpful tools include your computer operating system, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/), [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/), or [DeepL Write](https://www.deepl.com/write).

Use American spelling (OSP default, varies by client, taste, and location\!)

* Before: Choose your favourite colour scheme.  
* After: Choose your favorite color scheme. 

Favor universal clarity over regional language or idioms.

* Before: Some managers can’t see the wood for the trees  
* After:  Some managers can’t see beyond their daily tasks. 

Write right: Adapt tone and style to customer, situation, and context. Different people and companies address the world with different words. OSP creates content that our clients are happy to put their names to.

For example, striking the right balance between stuffy, formal language and too-casual language that sounds more conversational than written.

* Before: TYPO3 is really great for developers.   
* After: TYPO3 is ideal for developers.   
* Before:  Review testimonies from our satisfied customers.  
* After: Hear from our satisfied customers. 

No FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). No negative copy. Rather than criticize competitors, frame the challenges you solve for your clients—and highlight how you do it well.

* Before: Many content management systems come with a high risk of security vulnerabilities. TYPO3 keeps your installation protected with advanced security practices upheld by a dedicated team, a great developer experience, and a community of 500+ contributors to boot.  
* After: Keeping your website secure should always be top of mind. TYPO3 has the lowest number of vulnerabilities among enterprise CMSs, as rated by Security Management. 

### **\#5: Compelling**

*Tell stories. Use words, verbs, rhythm, and language that resonate.*

Use exciting verbs and nouns. [OneLook Thesaurus](https://onelook.com/thesaurus) is a great resource. 

* Before: TYPO3 helps agencies create digital value.   
* After: Agencies thrive on TYPO3

Use direct address whenever possible

* Before: A strong, extendable core that’s community-driven  
* After: Install TYPO3 Core and extend it as you go. 

Play with language: Try alliterations, varying rhythms, and metaphors—anything that grabs attention. 

* Example Article Headers Before:  
  * How Open Social got its start  
  * The Open Social feature set focuses on community  
  * The future of Open Social  
* Example Article Headers After:  
  * Open Social origin story  
  * Features focused on community  
  * The (funded) future of Open Social

Borrow effective syntax and sentence structure from examples around the web:

* Why not turn “Marketing smarts for big ideas.”  
* Into “Security teams for peace of mind.”?

Shout it out: When in doubt, read your text aloud to find the right rhythms.

* Before: Our CMS is secure, scalable, and fast.  
* After:  Our CMS is fast, secure, and scalable. 

### **\#6: Functional**

*A text has a job to do. Make sure it’s doing it.*

Product Communications is functional writing. Everything we write has a purpose and a goal. 

A product page shows your site visitor the benefits of adopting your offering, the challenges it helps them with, and how it solves those challenges. Furthermore, it needs clear calls-to-action or calls-to-value, snappy headers and taglines, pricing information and options, etc. 

A blog post about some aspect of the same product or service contains different elements. Compared to a product page, a blog may include (for example) anecdotes, tell a story, or explain the context of your solution that led you to create it. 

A tagline is a catchy summary representing your brand character, designed to attract the reader’s attention.

Be aware of what kind of asset you are creating and what components it needs:

* Each of those components is there for a reason and has a specific job to do.  
* Follow the best practices outlined in this guide for each.   
* Keep a sharp eye out for deviations from the purpose of your asset.  
* Stay focused, eradicate the irrelevant.




Writing content for technical products can be daunting, but focusing on clarity, empathy, and trust makes it easier. Follow these tips:

1. **Know your audience:** Understand their needs, challenges, and interests.
2. **Write clear, concise headlines:** Use 2-8 word taglines that capture attention.
3. **Emphasize benefits over features:** Explain how your product solves problems, not just what it does.
4. **Use consistent terminology:** Avoid introducing confusion by using multiple terms for the same concept.
5. **Tell a story:** Craft narratives that resonate emotionally with readers.

## How do I know what to write? The OSP Value Map

The OSP Value Map helps identify the core values of your product or service, serving as the foundation for all your communication assets. It bridges the gap between technical truths and audience expectations.

- **Value Cases:** Explain specific solutions to audience challenges.
- **Taglines:** Short phrases that encapsulate the product’s essence.
- **Positioning Statements:** Provide strategic clarity on what makes your product unique.

## Definitions, Best Practices, and Examples: Product Communication Components

### Trust
- **Empathy, clarity, and accuracy help build trust.**
- **Show that you understand your reader’s challenges.** They will identify themselves in your writing, trust you more, and keep reading.
- **Be transparent and honest about what you can’t offer** to build trust. Don’t sell vaporware ;-).
- **Avoid hyperbole.** It totally, massively, always helps, too.
- **Use (and explain) technical terminology accurately** to build trust.

### How Do I Know What to Write? The OSP Value Map
The OSP Value Map is a methodology and toolkit we use for content ideation and insight generation. Once yours is up and running, you'll never be stuck for content ideas again.

We typically start most engagements with a Value Map (VM) of the client product or service we are working on. To create your VM, together with you and your stakeholders, we:
1. Conduct a deep technical analysis of your offering.
2. Capture all its features.
3. Organize the features into logical-functional groupings.
4. Map the relationships between the functionalities and the business value they deliver.

You get a comprehensive inventory of the following modular components and entities from which we can create messaging, positioning, and content assets.

**Product-based VM Component/Entity Hierarchy:**
- **Product (or Service)**
  - Tagline
  - Positioning Statement
  - USPs
  - Solution Statements
- **Feature Category**
  - Name
  - Tagline
  - Value Case
    - Benefit
    - Challenge
    - Solution
- **Feature Area**
  - Name
  - Tagline
  - Value Case
    - Benefit
    - Challenge
    - Solution
- **Feature**

## Definitions, best practices, and examples: product communication components

### Taglines: 2-8 Word Headlines
#### What is a tagline, and what is its purpose?
Taglines are short sentences or fragments, typically found at the top of the page or as section headers. Their purpose is to grab attention while introducing the content that follows. They are often the most verbally playful and brand-driven statements.

#### Tagline Examples
- *Free and open, it’s our heart* ([Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/))
- *Marketing smarts for big ideas* ([Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/))
- *Work on big ideas without the busywork.* ([Asana](https://asana.com/))
- *Your tech is complex. Your message shouldn’t be.* ([Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/))

#### Tagline Best Practices
- Keep taglines short and rhythmic.
- Experiment with alliteration, wordplay, and rhyming.
- Feel free to use fragments.
- Capture brand character and values.
- Make taglines clever, attention-grabbing, and stand out.
- Look for opportunities for interplay between tagline, graphics, and context.

## Brand and Product Positioning Statements

### What is a positioning statement?
Positioning statements describe a product or brand's unique value to its audience. These are typically concise yet compelling sentences or short paragraphs that explain who the product is for, what it does, and how it differentiates itself from competitors.

---

### Elements of a Strong Positioning Statement
- **Target Audience:** Identify the intended users or customers.
- **Key Benefits:** Highlight the specific value your product provides.
- **Differentiation:** Explain what makes your product or service unique.
- **Proof Points:** Support your claims with data, testimonials, or other evidence.

#### Example Positioning Statement:
*"For technology teams needing fast and secure deployment pipelines, DevOpsX offers automated workflows and seamless integration with popular tools, enabling teams to ship better code faster. Unlike traditional CI/CD systems, DevOpsX features intuitive interfaces and a flexible pricing model."*

---

### Best Practices for Writing Positioning Statements
1. Focus on clarity and conciseness.
2. Write for your target audience.
3. Highlight how your product solves specific problems.
4. Use precise, jargon-free language.
5. Test your positioning statement with a sample audience.

## Features, Feature Areas, and Feature Categories

### Features
**What is a Feature, and what is its purpose?**  
A feature is the “atomic unit” of functionality or attribute of a product or service, i.e., what it does.

#### Keywords
- create
- edit
- generate
- provide
- enable
- empower
- improve  
(All strong, active verbs that imply a doer.)

#### Examples
- **Edit in the frontend or backend:** With drag and drop, copy and paste, spell checking, and other standard text editing functions.
- **Manipulate images directly in the CMS backend:** Crop and resize images, add frames/borders, watermarks, overlays, and more.
- **Automatically generate responsive images:** Deliver an optimized experience on every screen size.
- **Use the intuitive interface:** Control element positioning and page layout.
- **Bulk edit pages and preview content:** Before publishing.
- **Create dynamic and responsive forms:** With a drag-and-drop form builder.

---

### Feature Areas
**What is a Feature Area, and what is its purpose?**  
Feature Areas are logical-functional groupings of functionality—collections of Features.
